        This is not just another badge I wish to add to my profile but a vision I share with my co-founders and that's to establish a platform for professionals engraved on African soil.
        
        I have never needed your help better than I do now because the time calls upon us to arise and challenge the status quo.
        
        At Scholarly, we are eager to serve you better by creating a marketplace that helps you find your tribe, collaborate with friends on projects, connect with like-minded individuals and grow together, attend free events in person/virtually, find study-abroad opportunities and place you in opportunities to earn money through gigs and side hustles.
        
        Whether we succeed or fail is not a subject of discussion but what's important is that we worked, we defied the norm, and we faced every challenge, barrier and confrontation with one goal in mind to see this platform come to life but we can't do it alone, we need you, we need you to win as one.
        
        we have a goal of having 10,000 people on our waitlist before our launch next month.
        
        Join our waitlist at scholarlyme.com
         and share this post. If we must win, we do it together, and in doing it together, we win as one. Cheers.`,
